            <p>Hi everyone! I’m Marwan, a rising senior at Hunter College studying Computer Science. 
                I really enjoy the problem-solving and building aspects of comp sci and it's been great to be able to do both. 
                I've previously worked at Justworks and was a Salesforce 2023 FTL Scholar. When I'm not working on school stuff, 
                I like to get involved in side projects or check out hackathons when they're available. These projects give me a chance 
                to work with new tech that we don’t see much in class. And when I’m not programming, you can find me trying to improve my cooking 
                skills. I’m not the best, but I’m working on it!</p>
